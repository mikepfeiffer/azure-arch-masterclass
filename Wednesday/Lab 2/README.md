# Lab 2 - Azure Automation Runbooks

1. Create an automation account w/ RunAs account
2. Write a runbook that will start/stop a virtual machine based on a schedule. Imagine you're building a runbook that makes sure your instances run only during business hours
3. Try invoking your runbook using a webhook from an external app (powershell, curl, etc.)
